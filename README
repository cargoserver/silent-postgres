SilentPostgres
==============

Silences internal diagnostic messages from postgresql connection adapter.

Enabled only in development and test environments, skips production for 
performance reasons - logging is probably disabled there anyway.

Note that postgresql itself will also issue some extra logs for things like `implicit sequences`.  Looks like this:

    NOTICE: CREATE TABLE / PRIMARY KEY will create implicit index ...

To disable this logging, use this config option in your Rails `database.yml`

    test:
      ...
      min_messages: WARNING
